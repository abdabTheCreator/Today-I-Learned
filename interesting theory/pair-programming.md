> While we don't pair program 100% of the time, there is no better collaboration between designers, developers, or between designers and developers than at the keyboard.

## Thoughtbots checklist 

### Before
- Agree on scope 
- Agree on location 
- Agree on working environment
- Agree on pairing style

### During

- Keep both involved 
- Keep breaking 
- Keep checking in 

### After
