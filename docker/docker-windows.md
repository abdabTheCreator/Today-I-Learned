# Running docker in windows 

As docker runs on a linux kernel you need a subsytem installed on your windows machine 

I had issues building a Dockerfile as the docker damoen was not running due to not having the windows subsytem for linux installed.

You can install the necessary environment from: `https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi`
